TODO:
- Visibility icons should hide lines in projection windows as well
- scroll to zoom (z to reset shortcut)
- Left and right panels adjust to viewport height
- 100 micron scale bar (changes with zoom) in z window top left
- Color key in bottom right of z window
- Allow ctrl-F for find on page (dont jump to text search when control held)
- Update wiki with new help information
- Share and load current configurations with URL text codes (selected lines, slice numbers and volume orientation, etc.)
- Oblique view

Known Bugs:
- Window already marked once (partial projection) even when it hadn't been clicked
- color becomes slightly darker in z window when below slice ~120
- volumes are sometimes stretched after dismissing maximum projection, go away on hover
- black box appears over window when selecting then deselecting same region (only occurs until huc-cer is deselected, then reselected)

Browser Issues:
- Cursor changing on mouse down over 3D volume window not working properly in chrome
- Slider input thumbs look weird/cutoff in edge
- decimal not working in number inputs in firefox
- Titles on info popup windows not showing up in edge
- Popovers acting strangely in firefox (active popover not disappearing when another color button is selected)
