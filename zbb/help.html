    <h><strong>Zebrafish Brain Browser Project</strong></h>
    <p>The Zebrafish Brain Browser (ZBB) enables visualization of the 3D expression patterns of transgenic
      and enhancer trap lines in zebrafish, developed by the Burgess lab at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver
      National Institute for Child Health and Human Development, in collaboration with the Advanced
      Research Computing group at Virginia Tech.
    </p>
    <p>The atlas includes brain images of transgenic lines scanned at high resolution and registered
      to a reference brain so that all lines can be compared in the same spatial framework. For more
      information, please see:

    <p> There are two interfaces for ZBB. You are currently looking at the online version
      (<a href="zbbrowser.com">zbbrowser.com</a>).
      You can download a desktop version from the link above.</p>
    <p> The online version runs in any web browser. Javascript must be not be disabled.
      If accessing ZBB from an older computer or laptop, you may need to select 'L' (low)
      resolution from the Settings Tab and deselect the 'Show Volume' option. You will probably not be able
      to use Virtual Reality mode, and performance will lag if you try to view more than 2 lines at once.</p>

  <!-- Slice and Projection Views Section -->
  <div id="views">
    <h><strong>Slice and Projection Views</strong></h>
    <p>On startup, the top left, top right and bottom left windows display a single sagittal, coronal and
      horizontal slice through the brain of a HuC:Cer transgenic larva.</p>
    <p>The scroll bars allow you to change the position of the slice. The position (in microns) in the
      ZBB reference brain is indicated at the bottom left corner of each image. The blue cross hairs in
      each image indicate the position of the corresponding slices in the other two images.</p>
    <p>Left-click on any point in any of the three images to change the position of the slices displayed
      in the other two images. The anatomical identity (if known) at the selected point is displayed
      beside the &#39;Region&#39; label below the 3D window. To outline the boundaries of the region that
      includes the selected point use shift-left-click.</p>
    <p>Zoom into an area using the mouse scroll wheel. Hold down the shift-ctrl and left-mouse button
      to move the position of the zoomed image.</p>
    <p>To expand the image for any plane, select the blue arrow icon in the top right of each image.
      Return to the multiple-slice view by clicking on the same icon</p>
    <p>The top-left corner of the sagittal (top left) image provides a color-coded indication of the lines
      currently selected.</p>
    <p>To see a maximum projection through any plane, select the &#39;Max&#39; button in the top-right of each
      image. Return to a single slice view by clicking &#39;Slice&#39;. You can also generate partial projections
      through selected brain subregions by right-clicking twice in one image to designate the
      boundaries of the partial projection. A yellow line indicates the boundaries. For example, if you
      right-click slightly to the left and right of the olfactory placodes in the horizontal (bottom-right)
      plane, the coronal view (top-right) will now show a coronal projection of the olfactory bulbs.
      Clear a projection and return to single-slice view by selecting &#39;Slice&#39;.</p>
    <p>Summary of mouse controls:
      <br>Left button: change selected slices
      <br>Shift-left button: display anatomical region around selected point
      <br>Scroll wheel: zoom
      <br>Control-shift-left button: pan zoomed image
      <br>Right button: set boundaries for partial projections</p>
    <p>Keyboard shortcuts:
      <br>a: show all anatomical regions
      <br>f: find text match
      <br>m: maximum projections
      <br>x: toggle cross-hairs
      <br>z: reset to 1x zoom
      <br>1-9: show/hide selected line</p>

  <!-- 3D Projection Section -->
  <div id="3d">
    <h><strong>3D Projection</strong></h>
    <p>The bottom-right image is a 3D rendering of the brain volume. Use the mouse to rotate and
      zoom the 3D image:</p>
    <p>Left button: free-rotation of the 3D perspective
      <br>Right button: zoom
      <br>Control left button: pan image</p>
    <p>Clicking on the axis-arrows at the bottom-right of the image start and stop rotation of the image
      in each direction.</p>
    <p>To reset the 3D projection to its default position, click on the grey ball in the middle of the axis-
      arrows.</p>
    <p>Expand the 3D view using the arrow icon at the top-right of the image.</p>
    <p>Click on the VR icon to open a new browser window for a virtual-reality 3D view of the brain.
      The virtual reality view is designed to work either with Google Cardboard or using a wide-view
      side-by-side viewer to produce a stereo image from the images on the monitor.</p>
    <p>For Cardboard you need to access the website using your cellphone, select the lines you are
      interested in, then slip the phone into a cardboard viewer. Depressing the cardboard button
      moves you forward in whatever direction you are currently looking. You will need a high-end
      phone and may still be limited in the number of lines that you can have simultaneously
      displayed.</p>
    <p>For side-by-side viewing you need a wide-view stereo viewer to produce a stereo view from the
      two images on your computer monitor. We use catalog #PVN-SWV from 3dstereo.com (also
      available from Amazon). Left mouse button rotates. Scroll wheel to zoom. Shift-left to pan.</p>
    <p>You can toggle visibility of lines using the checkboxes at the top of the window.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Lines Tab Section -->
  <div id="lines">
    <h><strong>Lines Tab</strong></h>
    <p>ZBB contains image stacks for around 250 transgene expression patterns. Patterns are organized
      into four tabs:
      <br>- Transgenic: transgenic lines using BAC recombination or defined promoters to drive a
      reporter
      <br>- Gal4: enhancer traps expressing Gal4
      <br>- Cre: enhancer traps expresssing Cre
      <br>- Misc: everything else (immunohistochemistry, dye fills, various other enhancer traps)</p>
    <p>Each tab contains a list of lines with a checkbox, the name of the line, and a reference for the
      line (generally where it was first published). Clicking on the reference opens a new browser tab
      with the corresponding PubMed entry.</p>
    <p>Clicking on the checkbox for a line downloads its image stack and adds it to the brain view. Use
      the control panel at the bottom of the tab to change the display color and intensity.</p>
    <p>Finally, the &#39;Custom&#39; tab allows you to:
      <br>(1) Load your own data into the browser.
      <br>(2) Generate a new pattern that is the predicted intersect of currently selected patterns.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Control Panel Section -->
  <div id="control">
    <h><strong>Control Panel</strong></h>
    <p>The control panel allows you to adjust the display for each currently selected line, and access
      further information.</p>
    <p>The name of the line is displayed in a button on the left. Click on the button to reveal a color
      palette and select a new display color. Click on the button again to close the palette. The
      bottom-right element in the palette is the ImageJ Fire look-up table.</p>
    <p>Brightness/contrast are adjusted using the sliders or by directly entering values in the fields to
      the right of the sliders.</p>
    <p>On the right side of the line beside the name of the line are 5 additional icons. From right to left:
      <br>- X: removes this line from the display
      <br>- Reset: returns brightness/contrast/color to defaults.
      <br>- i: opens a pop-up window with more information about the line including links to PubMed
      records for its generation and confocal scanning, and ZFIN entry (click-through to ZIRC to
      order lines). Anatomical annotation and genomic integration site is also provided if available.
      <br>- eye icon: toggle visibility of line
      <br>- number (1-9): keyboard shortcut for toggling visibility</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Anatomy Tab Section -->
  <div id="anatomy">
    <h><strong>Anatomy Tab</strong></h>
    <p>Show boundaries of either manually annotated neuroanatomical regions (Z-Brain, Randlett et al
      Nature Methods 2015) or computationally derived regions (Pajevic, Gupta et al Methods 2018).</p>
    <p>First, select either the &#39;Z-Brain&#39; or &#39;Pajevic&#39; button at the top of the tab. Then use checkboxes to
      toggle display of different regions. The Z-Brain regions are organized by larger brain areas.</p>
    <p>The Reset button turns off all selected regions.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Aliases Tab Section -->
  <div id="aliases">
    <h><strong>Aliases Tab</strong></h>
    <p>Quickly find cell-types or brain regions of interest that are well-labeled by specific transgenic
      lines. These are simply shortcuts to finding specific transgenic lines that label structures of
      interest. In most cases a selected line also labels other structures, and may not label all of the
      selected structure.</p>
    <p>Selecting a checkbox simply loads the corresponding transgenic line. Its display qualities can
      then be adjusted using the control panel.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Search Tab Section -->
  <div id="search">
    <h><strong>Search Tab</strong></h>
    <p>The Brain Browser provides two kinds of search: spatial or text. Use the buttons at the top of
      the tab to chose spatial or text.</p>
    <p>Text search: Enter free text in the &#39;search&#39; field. As you type, all information (including
      anatomical information, integration site, publications history etc) associated with a line is
      searched and matches displayed in a table below.</p>
    <p>Spatial search: Search for lines that show expression in a selected 3-dimensional volume.
      <br>Steps:
      <br>(1) Click the orange &#39;Start&#39; button.
      <br>(2) Hold down the left-mouse button to select an area in any of the three slice windows.
      <br>(3) Hold down the left mouse button in a different slice window to complete the volume</p>
    <p>The selected volume is indicated as a yellow box visible in the slice windows. Lines that
      express reporter in the selected volume are displayed in the table below, with the line name and
      the percentage of the volume selected that is labeled by that line.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Section Tab Section -->
  <div id="settings">
    <h><strong>Settings Tab</strong></h>
    <p>If ZBB is laggy on your computer, then (1) Turn off &#39;Show Volume&#39; and (2) Select Low
      resolution.</p>
    <p>Invert color - flips color-scales so that the brain is grey on a white-background (and all other
      colors are simply inverted as well).</p>
    <p>Show volume - toggles display of the bottom-right 3D view of the brain. Deselect this on less
      powerful computers to improve performance.</p>
    <p>Show cross-hairs - toggles visibility of the cross-hairs that indicate the plane of section for each
      slice view.</p>
    <p>Hide annotations - select to remove all annotations in the slice windows - useful if you are
      taking a screenshot.</p>
    <p>Projection depth coding - color-codes lines by depth when in a projection view (no effect in
      slice view).</p>
    <p>Resolution - select either Low, Medium or High image quality. Selecting Low will improve
      rendering performance by your computer, and download speed from our servers.</p>
    <p>Window Size - to best fit your monitor, select either Small, Medium or Large to adjust the
      relative size of the image slices and tab windows</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Data Tab Section -->
  <div id="data">
    <h><strong>Download Tab</strong></h>
    <p>Options to download a stack with all lines that are selected, or the current set of slices.</p>
    <p>Download the currently selected stack as a set of 419 horizontal images. The png images are in
      a compressed folder that you can unzip. If multiple lines are selected, the stack will simply be
      the composite of these lines with the existing colors as currently displayed on your screen.</p>
